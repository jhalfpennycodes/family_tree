cd into repository
cd into flask-server
Activate virtual environment with: source venv/bin/activate
Download requirements with: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app with: flask run

If the app is running in terminal but does not load in browser then delete cookies in browser!

To create a dummy database run python create_db.py, this will create a database with dummy data which mimics the structure on the Dummy family tree.jpeg file. You can also run python delete_db.py to delete all data in the current database.

The backend is incomplete and need to create a full API app in order to communicate with the react application front end.
